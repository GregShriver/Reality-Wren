# Reality-Wren
Repository for Carolina Wren ecology project

The focus of this project is to use automated recording units (ARUs) to investigate the behavior and phenology of Carolina Wren vocalizations (Thryothorus ludovicianus). In March 2023, we placed ARUs along an urban / rural gradient from the University of Delaware campus, North through the city of Newark, DE following White Clay Creek to Landenberg, PA.
